# Eval Frontend Mathieu GESLIN

## Generals

Front: React + Next
API: The api I made for the API evaluation will be used

Some instruction will be changed to match the API used
 
### Layouts
4 layouts:
- 1 auth/register (maybe split it)
- 1 admin
- 1 company
- 1 freelance


### theming

For light theme: shades of white and grey accentuated with orange elements, dark font
For dark theme: shades of black, also accentuated with orange elements, light grey font

## Instruction modifications

### Auth
Auth will not be declined, cause the in the API, users and companies are in the same collection, only a field into a document differs.
